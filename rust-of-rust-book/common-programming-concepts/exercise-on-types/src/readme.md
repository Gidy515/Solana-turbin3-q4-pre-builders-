# 🦀 Rust Array Indexing & Error Handling Exercise

## Introduction

This exercise demonstrates how **Rust ensures memory safety and reliability** when dealing with **user input, data parsing, and array indexing**.  
Rust prevents undefined behavior by stopping your program (panicking safely) if you attempt to access memory outside valid array bounds.

The goal of this exercise is to help you understand:

- How to read user input from the console
- How to handle potential parsing errors
- How Rust prevents unsafe memory access through runtime checks

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### 1️⃣ Create a new Rust project

```bash
cargo new array_indexing
cd array_indexing
```
