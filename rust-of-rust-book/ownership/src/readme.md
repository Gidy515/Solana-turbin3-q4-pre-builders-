# ü¶Ä RUST OWNERSHIP ‚Äî COMPLETE WALKTHROUGH

> A complete hands-on walkthrough of **Rust‚Äôs Ownership System**, explained in simple, visual, and practical terms.  
> Based on [*The Rust Programming Language Book* ‚Äî Chapter 4].

Ownership is the foundation of Rust‚Äôs _memory safety_. It eliminates common bugs such as:

- Use-after-free
- Double-free
- Data races  
  ...and it does so **without a garbage collector**.

## INTRODUCTION

Rust‚Äôs **ownership system** manages memory through a set of compile-time rules.  
There is no garbage collector or manual `malloc`/`free` ‚Äî Rust ensures **safe memory handling automatically**.

### Why It Matters

Ownership ensures:

- No null pointers
- No dangling references
- No data races (even in multi-threaded code)
- Memory safety without runtime overhead

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è OWNERSHIP RULES

1. Every value in Rust has **exactly one owner**.
2. When the owner goes **out of scope**, the value is **dropped** (freed).
3. Ownership can be **moved** or **borrowed**, but not both at the same time.

## 1. VARIABLE SCOPE

```rust
fn main() {
    let s = "hello"; // string literal stored in binary
    println!("{}", s);
} // s goes out of scope ‚Äî nothing special happens
```
